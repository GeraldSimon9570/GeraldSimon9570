## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my repository! This project represents my work as a machine learning researcher focused on building and fine-tuning state-of-the-art NLP models using the Hugging Face Transformers library. It explores advanced techniques in model customization, scalable deployment, and large-scale text analysis across a variety of natural language tasks.

The core of this project revolves around fine-tuning pretrained transformer modelsâ€”such as BERT, RoBERTa, or T5â€”on domain-specific datasets for tasks including text classification, question answering, summarization, and named entity recognition. Training workflows are built on Hugging Faceâ€™s Trainer API or custom PyTorch training loops, with support for mixed-precision training, gradient accumulation, and distributed computing to accelerate performance.

Beyond model training, a key emphasis is placed on deployment and inference. The project includes examples of exporting models to the Hugging Face Hub, deploying them with transformers pipelines, or serving them via FastAPI and TorchServe for low-latency API access. These deployment workflows are designed with scalability in mind, suitable for both research experiments and production environments.

Additionally, this repository tackles large-scale text analysis, leveraging the efficiency of transformer-based models to process vast corpora. Techniques such as batching, tokenization optimization, and memory-efficient inference are used to handle high-volume data with speed and accuracy.

Whether you're a researcher exploring fine-tuning strategies or an engineer looking to deploy NLP models at scale, this repository offers a comprehensive foundation for working with modern transformer architectures. The code is modular, reproducible, and aligned with current best practices in machine learning and natural language processing.
